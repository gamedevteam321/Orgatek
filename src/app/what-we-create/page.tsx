          We grow short rotation, high yield  timber on regenerated lands to replace deforestation-linked wood, convert forestry biomass into high-quality biochar for permanent soil carbon storage, and generate certified carbon credits rooted in measurable, durable climate impact. Our vertically integrated model transforms degraded land into climate assets â€” producing nature-based solutions that are traceable, verified, and built to scale.
